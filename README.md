# Elite for EMACS
Interpretation of the game Elite using Emacs. 
Originally inspired by [Ian Bell's Text Elite, C implementation of Elite trading system](http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/text/). 

## Background
See my blog post: [sami.salkosuo.net/elite-for-emacs](http://sami.salkosuo.net/elite-for-emacs/).

## Install
If you know Emacs then instructions in [elite-for-emacs-V1/README](https://github.com/samisalkosuo/elite-for-emacs/blob/master/elite-for-emacs-V1/README) and [elite-for-emacs-V2/elite-for-emacs.el](https://github.com/samisalkosuo/elite-for-emacs/blob/master/elite-for-emacs-V2/elite-for-emacs.el) 
make sense and you can try and play Elite for EMACS.

## Future
I have currently no plans to continue working with this and I make the code available for historic reasons and in the hope that 
some one finds even a small amount of enjoyment out of Elite for EMACS.

## License
The MIT License for my own code. Any and all code from Ian Bell and David Braben are theirs and I make no claim
of ownership and I don't license them in any way. I merely translated C to Emacs LISP. 
If in doubt, compare my code and original code. All other stuff from Elite/Frontier or some other source are from Elite/Frontier or some other source and I make no 
claims whatsoever that they are mine. If you know that something is from Elite/Frontier or some other source, 
then that is really the case, it's not mine.
